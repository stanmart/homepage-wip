Hi! I am Martin, a PhD student at the Economics department of the University of Zurich.

I enjoy tinkering with stuff until I figure out how it works. In a sense, that is my day job, as well. I also like learning new stuff, even when some of it goes over my head. I enjoy doing research.

I believe in the power of an interdisciplinary approach to both research and problem-solving. I really enjoy learning about all kinds of novel applications of mathematics to social-related fields. I enjoy discussing ideas and problems with others, and I also enjoy teaching those few things in which I am confident of my knowledge.

Just <a href="mailto:martin.stancsics@gmail.com">email me</a> if you would like to talk to me about something. Or if you would like to send me funny dog gifs. I appreciate those, too.
