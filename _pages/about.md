Hi! I am Martin, a PhD candidate at the University of Z端rich. I like industrial organization, behavioral economics, natural language processing, data visualization, and dogs.

I enjoy tinkering with stuff until I figure out how it works. In a sense, that is my day job, as well. I believe in an interdisciplinary approach to both research and general problem-solving. I enjoy discussing ideas and problems with others, and I also enjoy teaching those few things in which I am confident of my knowledge.

Just <a href="mailto:martin.stancsics@gmail.com">email me</a> if you would like to talk to me about something. Or if you would like to send me funny dog gifs. I appreciate those, too.
